    "Selling a call option means that you will provide someone else with the decision on whether or not to buy stock from you at a fixed price; i.e., the buyer of your call option decides whether or not you will be compelled to sell stock at the agreed upon price.  Buying a put option means that you get to exercise the option to sell stock at an agreed upon price to another party.  The sold call will only be executed by the buyer when the strike price is lower than the market price, so that the buyer of the call can buy stock from you at a discount and sell it for a profit in the market.  The bought put will only be executed by you when the strike price is higher than the market, so that you can buy stock in the market and sell it for a profit through the put.  Profiting by selling a call requires the price of the option to exceed the amount you expect the stock to drop during the lifetime of the option.  Profiting by buying a put requires the underlying to drop in value by an amount exceeding the price of the option."
