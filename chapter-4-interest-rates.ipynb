    "The liquidity preference theory of interest rates assumes that different rates for different loan durations are driven by opposing time preferences between lenders and borrowers.  All things being equal, borrowers are expected to prefer longer terms to lower their refinancing risk if rates go up and lenders are expected to prefer shorter terms to lower their opportunity cost if rates go up.  This results in an inbalanced demand for longer term loans from borrowers and an inbalanced supply for shorter term loans from lenders.  One expects, then, that lenders incentivize shorter-term loans with lower interest rates and lenders can charge higher interest rates for longer-term loans due to the increased demand."

    "An upward-sloping zero rate curve means that longer maturities pay higher interest rates.  The par yield is defined as the (semi-annual) coupon that compensates for the decreased present-value of the bond's principal at maturity.  These coupons are paid out at earlier times, where the present value is determined by the smaller, nearer-term zero rates between now and maturity.  As a result, the bond yield is partially weighted by rates lower than the one associated with the bond maturity.  \n",
