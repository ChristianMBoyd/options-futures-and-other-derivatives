    "The liquidity preference theory of interest rates assumes that different rates for different loan durations are driven by opposing time preferences between lenders and borrowers.  All things being equal, borrowers are expected to prefer longer terms to lower their refinancing risk if rates go up and lenders are expected to prefer shorter terms to lower their opportunity cost if rates go up.  This results in an inbalanced demand for longer term loans from borrowers and an inbalanced supply for shorter term loans from lenders.  One expects, then, that lenders incentivize shorter-term loans with lower interest rates and lenders can charge higher interest rates for longer-term loans due to the increased demand."

The assets can be obtained at a sufficient bargain that the lender is in-the-money even if the borrower never buys them back.
